Family History Sheet in LaTeX
## What is this for?
I intend to write a book, using LaTeX, with the results of all my family history research, together with that of my father before me. I intend to use the LaTeX package genealogytree to produce trees. I also want to produce Family Group Sheets. I can find versions in pdf format, and as Word documents and Excel spreadsheets, but none on LaTeX. the linux programme gramps is able to produce Family Group Sheets in LaTeX, but the code is very bloated, and the end result not at all what I want.

I am very grateful to stackexchange users MS-SPO and L.J.R. for cleaning up my first efforts.

## Wish List

1. Use booktabs to enable styling of lines;
2. Add cross-references between table. Parents on one sheet will be children on another, and, of course, vice-versa. References both ways would be useful.
3. Connect to database for automated batch-production of Family Group Sheets. If you intent to develop this in that direction, please do not do that with this repository. This is for small-scale production: having to create a database for two or three sheets could be a laborious process itself.

Enjoy!
